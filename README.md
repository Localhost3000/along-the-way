Along the Way!

This simple app marries the functionality of Yelp with that of Google Maps. Enter start and end points and hit &ldquo;Go&rdquo;you&rsquo;ll see all the points of interest between here and there!

Tests

You can run the browser-based tests with `grunt test`. Unit tests live in the `test` directory. Have fun. :)
